# Gotree

Gotree emulates the classic "tree" program and recursively traverses a directory and printing its entries out in a tree structure.

# Todo

- Filter hidden files before the traverse loop to make detecting the last entry in a directory work correctly (for printing the LBAR structure)
- Directory symlinks are currently counters as files, not directories
- Terminal colour rendering
