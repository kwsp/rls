# rls

rls emulates the classic "tree" program and recursively traverses a directory while printing its entries in a tree-like structure.

## Usage

Invoking `rls` without any arguments displays the current directory. Alternatively, give rls the path to a directory and it will display the target directory. 

## Installation


```bash
go get github.com/tiega/rls
```
